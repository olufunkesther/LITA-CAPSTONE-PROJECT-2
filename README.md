  EDA involved the exploring of the Data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
  - what is customers preference based on subscription type?
  - which subscription type had the highest revenue?
  - what is the trend of cancellation and renewal?

#### Customer's Preference
Based on the calculation done, the Basic Subscription had the highest Revenue of **33,776,735** compared to the Premium and Standard Subscription with **16,899,064** and **16,864,374** respectively. This shows customer's preference for Basic subscription which seemed more affordable compared to the other 2 subsciption types.

##### Recommendation
There should be targeted promotions and advertisement on Premium and standard subscription types. This means that it should be marketed more to customers who prioiritize luxury over affordability. More campaigns should be done on Basic subscription to increase revenue.
